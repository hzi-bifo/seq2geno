MissingOutputException in line 25 of /net/sgi/metagenomics/data/from_moni/old.tzuhao/seq2geno/dev_versions/v4/test.smk:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
tmp/extracted_proteins_nt/test_indels.gff
tmp/extracted_proteins_nt/test_indel_stats.txt
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job vcf_to_indels_per_fam since they might be corrupted:
./test_indels.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
