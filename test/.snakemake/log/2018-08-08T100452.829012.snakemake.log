Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:

MissingOutputException in line 12 of /net/sgi/metagenomics/data/from_moni/old.tzuhao/seq2geno/dev_versions/v4/test/test.smk:
Missing files after 5 seconds:

This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
