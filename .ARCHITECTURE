Rule:
A rule is a function encapsulated in a folder, 
where (1) the script snakemake rule and (2) its external script (.py/.R) are located. 
The external scripts may further need some other scripts, which are typically shared.
These scripts are not under the same directory. Instead, they are in a shared library.
Nothing will be written in the rule folders. 

Recipe:
A recipe is a snakemake script to execute a workflow. 
Basically, the scripts has only the function "include", because the order of rules should be 
computed by snakemake.

Book:
A book is a tool set where all the functions are mounted. It determines the recipes based on the
required output. It describes the environment, which includes the materials that will be required by 
the rules and the paths. It is the universe of variable space where the attached rules can search.
